# Spam-Detection
A machine learning project for detecting spam emails using traditional ML models (no deep learning).

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing of text data (cleaning, tokenization, vectorization)
- Machine learning models: Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## 📂 Dataset
- Dataset used: [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection)
- Format: CSV file with labels (`spam` / `ham`) and messages

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- NLTK (optional for text preprocessing)
